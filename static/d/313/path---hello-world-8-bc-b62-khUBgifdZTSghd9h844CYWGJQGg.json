Rushing User\nBut, if you can, just add a simple “Browse without account” button on your app. You will see that once experienced, once they completely understand why and how your service will ease their life, the users will definitely want to be a part of it and create an account. And the people who will signup here will be the one true users because they did sign up completely intentionally.</p>\n<p>I think the statement above sums it up, you shouldn’t ask for a user to log in or give in his data before even showing him why your app deserves his attention or data. I know some apps need to know about the user prior to him using it but I think you can always figure a way to give value before you ask for it.</p>\n<p>Don’t ask them to invite their friends nor rate you\nSeriously I don’t think users invite other people to use an app no one does that, it’s odd and weird, if I want my friend to use this X app I simply tell him to download and explain the benefits and tell him how cool I I’m because I’m using it or how it has changed, improved or helped me doing X thing. Word of mouth is the kind of invite or recommendation that people want, not receiving a message or an email saying user X invited you to use this app, how is the app supposed to solve my problem if it’s already creating a new one by spamming me?</p>\n<p>Prefer Google sign in over traditional email-password\nWhen you use Google Sign in with play services or firebase authentication, it creates an intent that shows a dialog for the user, where he can select the email to use in his app, unlike Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin (that usually requires opening another app or a browser) it does not require opening browser or another app to log in.\nOpening the browser or external apps uses RAM and processing power, which is not what you want your app to do, because most devices have low RAM, processing power and scarce, even if they have good processing power it’s highly likely that they opened dozen other apps besides yours.s</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Things developers can do to improve the UX","date":"April 14, 2019","description":"spoiler alert"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":null}}
